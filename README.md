1.	Introduction

1.1.	Background
According to Innovation, Science & Economic Development Canada statistics, thousands of businesses exit the marketplace every year in Canada. Business failure statistics show that about 96 percent of small businesses (1–99 employees) that enter the marketplace survive for one full year, 85 percent survive for three years and 70 percent survive for five years (Key Small Business Statistics). Approximately 7,000 businesses go bankrupt every year in Canada

According to an Industry Canada study, "the main reason for (business) failure is inexperienced management and planning.

1.2.	Business Problem
With the help of data science I will analyse the neighbourhoods in Toronto. These insights would be beneficial to someone who is looking to open a new restaurant or trying to expand his chain. It will help those investors to decide where to open the restaurant and which type of cuisines would be beneficial for their business.

1.3.	Data Sourcing
First, I will web scrape the Wikipedia page of Canadian neighbourhoods. Clean that data and filter out all the neighbourhoods other than Toronto’s. I will use foursquare API to get all the venues in each neighbourhood and then analyse that data to get the desired results.
